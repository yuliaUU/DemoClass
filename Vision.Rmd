# Why Study Data Science (DS)?

<font size="8">

1. Technical jobs
2. Everyday living
3. Logical Mind Training

</font>


## DS offers a full set of problem solving skills:

- Defining questions
- Translate to language of math/statistics (*real world to "math"*)
- Compute results
- interprete/ communicate results (*"math" to real world*)

No uniform approach to teach DS.

# DS at the undergraduate level

::: nonincremental

- Essential to developing critical thinking, streamlining the work process, and mastering organizational skills. 
- To provide a clear idea of what this field is. 
- Computer literacy and skills are more demanding and valuable than ever.

------------------------------------

I don't think that a single 'information session' will be sufficient 

::: nonincremental
- Introduction to Data Science course  
- Overarching theme: iterative 'lifestyle' process of DS: 
- Get acquainted with a plethora of various techniques and methods, along with their strengths, weaknesses, and applicability. 
- workflow + organisation
::: 


-------------------------------------------------------------

If interested, students need to have a chance to explore the field in more detail. 

::: nonincremental
- DS is an inherently interdisciplinary area 
- Taken as a double major or minor  
- ‘Connector’ courses 
::: 

------------------------------------------------------- 

DS students can be a catalyst for new thinking in interdisciplinary approaches. 

::: nonincremental
- Theory track to target students with strong theoretical fundamentals 
- Speaker series, Networking events, Internship opportunities 
:::


# DS during a transition period

::: nonincremental
- In many universities,BSc in computer science or statistics is a prerequisite to getting into MDS. 
- UBC takes a different approach.
- Increases diversity in the classroom
- But also creates wider gap between students
:::

::: fragment
::: nonincremental

To bridge the gap and to introduce people to the field 

- conversion courses 
- a short crash course (2–4 weeks) 
:::
:::

# DS at the graduate level

DS aim to solve real-world problems, to address domain-specific problems, and to create experiential learning opportunities for students. 

- Engaging students through a capstone project, practicum courses, or short-term work
- Many opportunities should be created to expose students to cutting-edge developments in data science for further study.

Furthermore, education does not just happen in school and is not necessary for university students only.

- Apart from bringing students to the business world, as educators, we need to bring business owners to us.

----------------------------------

- Bridging courses between different UBC departments.
- Many grad students working on their theses do not have enough statistical training and are not familiar with proper data analysis workflow. 
- Data literacy should be one of the central themes of data science education.

# Distance Education courses & Online Materials

- Microcertificate Program
- DE course for programming in R
